# Chicken Parmesan

A classic Italian-American dish featuring breaded chicken cutlets topped with marinara sauce and melted cheese.

## Ingredients

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 cups Italian breadcrumbs
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 2 cups marinara sauce
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 lb pasta (spaghetti or linguine)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil for frying
- Fresh basil for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the chicken**: Pound chicken breasts to even thickness (about 1/2 inch). Season with salt and pepper.

2. **Set up breading station**: In one shallow bowl, beat eggs. In another, mix breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.

3. **Bread the chicken**: Dip each chicken breast in egg, then coat thoroughly with breadcrumb mixture.

4. **Fry the chicken**: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry chicken until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking dish.

5. **Add toppings**: Spoon marinara sauce over each chicken breast. Top with mozzarella and remaining Parmesan cheese.

6. **Bake**: Bake at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.

7. **Cook pasta**: While chicken bakes, cook pasta according to package directions.

8. **Serve**: Serve chicken over pasta, garnished with fresh basil.

## Notes
