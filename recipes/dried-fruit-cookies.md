# Dried Fruit Cookies
## Notes
> These freeze well for weeks. NEVER DOUBLE! It makes boatloads!

> I found the dates mix better if I chop them. You can also buy them chopped which also
> lessens the odds of getting dates with overlooked pits remaining in them. The down
> side to pre-chopped is that it's harder to find them so and not dusted with sugar.

> Previously used a gluten friendly flour alternative that worked but forgot to log it:
> - Tried using coconut flour on a batch and that absolutely did NOT work.
>   - Came out like gritty sand and didn't stick together for the right texture at all.
> - Maybe Garbanzo flour?

> This adapts well for vegan folks:
> - "Just Egg, Plant-Based Egg" - worked.
> - Margarine for butter & oat milk worked well.

> Not sure if it makes a difference but since these are usually made around Thanksgiving
> time I like to use Wild Turkey as the brand of whiskey.

## Have Ready
### Dried Fruits
- 2 pounds (4 1/2 cups) Pecans
- 1/2 lb (or more... roughly a touch less than 1 cup) each:
  - dates (not sweetened)
  - dried cherries (not sweetened)
  - raisins (plain dried)

### Spiced Cookie Flour Ingreadients
In a large salad/serving bowl sift these together:
- 3 cups flour
- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 teaspoons each:
  - cinnamon
  - nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon each:
  - ground cloves
  - ground ginger

### Cookie Wet Ingreadients
Mix all of these together:
  > Mixer on slower settings works.
  > Since the other ingreadients will be joining these - use a large bowl. Mixer sized bowl at smallest.
- 1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 4 eggs (preferably large)
- 3 tablespoons milk
- 1/2 cup whiskey

## Bringing It All Together
- Gradually add dry sifted ingredients to wet batter.
- Gradually mix in fruit and nuts.
- Bring it all to an even mix.

## The Bake
- Drop by teaspoonful, or ice scream scooper, on to greased cookie sheet. I now use parchment paper.
- Bake for 30 minutes @ 250 degrees.
